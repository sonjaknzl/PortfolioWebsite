            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">This design work was part of a university project and involved the creation
                of an app concept
                as well as the development of the CRUD app in Android Studio with Kotlin and SQLite.

            <h4 class="headingRight headingWork">idea and motivation</h4>
            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">The general app idea was to implement a digital plant encyclopedia/ diary.
                The user can create entries in
                the app for each of their houseplants. The entry includes information like the plant’s name, the plant
                species, date of purchase, date of
                last irrigation. The entries are stored in a database using SQLite. Furthermore, the app calculates and
                displays the next date of next irrigation per
                plant, so that the user knows
                when to
                next water the plants. Some first wireframe designs for the app were created in Figma.<br>

        <div class="paragraph addMarginTop10">
            <h4 class="headingWork headingRight">data class plant</h4>
            <p>A central part of the app consists of the data class 'plant' which represents the entries the user
                creates, updates, reads and deletes.
                The name, species, purchaseDate, waterDate are set when user creates a new entry. The nextWaterDate
                is calculated dynamically based
                on the waterDate (last time user watered their plant) & species (value for the
                optimal number of days between watering the plants stored in external CSV file).
                The infoText is based
                on the plant species and is dynamically fetched from external CSV file.

                without having to change code) and gives the future opportunity to fetch data from the internet. The CSV
                file is read and the info is stored in a database.<br>

                RecyclerView. As there is one id missing now, the entries are not ascending seamlessly. Therefore, the
                entries are transferred into another new table and given new unique ascending ids. The old table is
                deleted.

                    As this work was part of a university project and the first time I was working with Android Studio
                    and
                    Kotlin, there is room for code refinement. Nevertheless, I am content with the result and the
                    progress I
                    made
                    working with Kotlin and SQLite.
                    From the perspective of UX, some user testings would need to be conducted to evaluate the intuitive
                    use
                    of the app.</p>

                    Further refinements could include:

                    <li>Stay in
