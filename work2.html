            <h3>SPRYZE</h3>
            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">This work was part of a university project.
                The project was to enhance the existing concept of "SPRYZE", which empowers influencers to create more
                compelling and engaging content while earning extra income via direct micropayments from their
                followers. My two team members and I decided to focus on the perspective of marketing managers.
            </p>
            <h4 class="headingWork">interviews</h4>
            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">We began with a market research looking at applications that are currently
                available in the field of
                influencer marketing. We then conducted interviews with potential users to understand their needs and
                problems.

            <h4 class="headingWork">customer journey</h4>
            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">Based on the interview insights, a customer journey map from the perspective
                of a
                marketing manager was
                created.
                This helped to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement for managers to start
                collaborations with influencers.

            <img class="fullWidthImg spryzeCI" src="assets/spryze-cj.png" alt="final design timetable">

            <p><br>The following aspects were identified as the most important pain points:
            <ul>
                <li>long research process</li>
                <li>retrieving current status per campaign</li>

            <h4 class="headingWork">use cases</h4>
            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">After having explored various aspects of our future users and stakeholders,
                we came up with a concept to
                improve their pain points. Our idea was to implement a matching algorithm between company accounts and
                influencers based on their interests. The central functionality was to be a swiping mechanism to accept
                or decline campaigns. An additional dashboard would provide an overview of the
                current status of the campaigns.<br><br>
                The main use cases that we wanted to realise in our app were determined:
            <ul>
                <li>match cooperations and influencers</li>
                <li>match cooperations and challenges </li>
                <li>check kpis of influencers</li>
                <li>monitor status of campaign</li>
                <li>communicate with influeners</li>

            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">After reviewing the drafts in our team and refining certain aspects, we
                implemented the corresponding
                wireframe
                designs
                in Figma.

            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">We continued with user testing to get early feedback on our wireframes. We
                conducted six interviews
                with
                potential users and asked them to complete certain tasks from the perspective of a marketing manager.
                The
                feedback was evaluated, discussed within our team and integrated into our prototype.

            <h4 class="headingWork unsetMarginTop">high-fidelity prototype</h4>
            <p class="fixedWidthParagraph">The next step was to create a high-fidelity prototype. We took the already
                implemented design for
                SPRYZE
                into consideration to not conflict with the existing design language. We created a Figma library
                consisting of components and variants to incorporate a consistent style
                throughout the app.

                Despite the considerable time and effort we have invested in this project, it would require additional
                refinement if it were a live project.
                Furthermore, accessibility aspects would have to be considered.
                However, we have made significant
                progress and the insights we have gained from user testing have been tremendously valuable.
